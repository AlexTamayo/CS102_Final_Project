Codecademy final project for Computer Science 102 - Recommendation Software Project

In this project I decided to do a software that recommends games from my own Nintendo Switch library based on selected categories.

In this project I implemented a lot of the lessons learnt in CS102 - Data Structures & Algorithms. I used a Trie as my search algorithm.
